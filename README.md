This notebook is the result of the practice carried out in the course ["Curso de Visualizaci√≥n de Datos con Matplotlib y Seaborn"](https://platzi.com/cursos/matplotlib-seaborn/), where the Data set "Methane_final" was used to evaluate methane emissions according to regions, countries and productive sectors. The analysis begins by looking at emissions at the regional level around the world, and then addresses the question of whether there is a relationship between population and emissions. After clarifying these concerns, we proceed to identify the emissions by regions and productive sectors.

To achieve a more detailed understanding, an analysis of emissions is carried out in relation to the main world powers and productive sectors. In addition, the same previous analysis is carried out but focused on Colombia, as an additional component.
